> Turn your real-world miles into virtual territory ownership. Claim H3 resolution-9 hexagonal tiles on a dynamic map, defend your turf from local rivals, and climb the global leaderboards. **Your footsteps build an empire.**

## 🚀 The Concept

Run-to-Own transforms real-world running data into a competitive, map-based strategy game. By partitioning maps into a hyper-precise hexagonal grid system powered by **Uber's H3**, every activity tracked via your wearable or phone expands your digital footprint. 

* **Discover & Claim:** Be the first athlete to run through an unclaimed tile to seize ownership.
* **Turf Wars:** If a rival runs more distance within your tile, ownership shifts. Defend your boundaries or go on the offensive.
* **Exploration Multipliers:** Rare and high-risk zones offer bonus points, breaking you out of standard running routes.

## ⚡ Core Features

### 🗺️ Geospatial H3 Grid Engine
* **Precision Hexagonal Mapping:** Utilizes Uber's H3-js (Resolution-9) geospatial index to partition the world into elegant, standardized hexagons.
* **Real-time Path Interpolation:** Integrates Turf.js (`@turf/turf`) and Mapbox polyline decoders to cleanly trace coordinates onto active grid cells.
* **Real-time Ownership Mutations:** Automatically calculates tile captures and hands over control during cross-user activity syncs.

### 🎮 Gamified Mechanics & Analytics
* **Performance Scoring:** Advanced scoring algorithms factoring in distance, elevation gain, and novel route tracking.
* **Streak Tracking:** Core background services measuring daily and weekly active streaks with unlockable milestone badges.
* **Social Hub & Leaderboard:** Search and follow friends, manage pending requests, and battle for the top spot on local leaderboards.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

The platform has been re-engineered from the ground up as a fully decoupled, serverless-ready Next.js application built to handle fast geospatial calculations and high performance.

## 💻 Local Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
* Node.js 18+ installed
* A Supabase Database (or any local PostgreSQL instance)
* A Strava Developer Account (Client ID, Client Secret)

### 1. Clone & Install Dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyvmag/Run-to-Own-.git
cd Run-to-Own-
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root of the project:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.xxx:YOUR_PASSWORD@...:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres.xxx:YOUR_PASSWORD@db.xxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres"

JWT_SECRET="your-super-secure-jwt-cookie-key"

STRAVA_CLIENT_ID="your_strava_client_id"
STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET="your_strava_client_secret"
STRAVA_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:3000/api/auth/strava/callback"

NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPTILER_KEY="your_maptiler_api_key"
```

### 3. Database Synchronization & Migrations
Synchronize your local database schema with your Supabase or PostgreSQL container:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

### 4. Run the Dev Server
Start the local server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` to log in and sync your profile.
